    <h1>PROVINCE OF PALAWAN</h1>
    <p>Palawan is a breathtaking province in the Philippines, often referred to as the "Last Frontier" due to its untouched natural beauty. It is renowned for its stunning landscapes, including pristine white-sand beaches, crystal-clear waters, limestone karst formations, and lush jungles. Palawan is home to several must-visit destinations, including El Nido, known for its dramatic karst scenery and island-hopping opportunities; Coron, famous for its underwater wrecks and diving sites; and Puerto Princesa, the provincial capital, where you can explore the underground river, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Palawan is a paradise for nature enthusiasts, offering opportunities for hiking, snorkeling, scuba diving, and wildlife encounters. Its unique blend of natural wonders and outdoor adventures makes it a top travel destination in the Philippines and the world.</p>
    <h3>Puerto Princesa</h3>
    <p>Puerto Princesa, city, east-central Palawan, Philippines. It is an important port on a sheltered inlet of the Sulu Sea, south of Honda Bay, and it has an airport. The city was formerly called Cuyo.Puerto Princesa is the main gateway to Palawan, with direct flights from Manila and other major cities in the Philippines. Even before the island became a popular tourist destination in the 90s, it was already a favored weekend getaway for wealthy Filipinos. Now, visitors from around the world are discovering the many wonders of this hidden gem.</p>
    <h3>Nacpan Beach (El Nido)</h3>
    <p>Nacpan Beach is one of the most beautiful stretches of sand in the Philippines. With four kilometres of soft cream-coloured sand, swaying coconut palms, a fishing village, clear aqua water and small surfable waves, it’s the kind of place you’d see if you closed your eyes and imagined paradise. Nacpan Beach is one-half of the famous ‘Twin Beaches’ (the other being Calitang Beach) – it’s where rustic palm-thatched huts line the beach with local restaurants serving up fresh seafood.</p>
    <h3>Kayangan Lake (coron)</h3>
    <p>Kayangan Lake is by far the most popular spot on Coron Island and for good reason. You cruise into the ‘parking lot’, which in itself is an immaculate reef with crystal clear water. After parking the boat you take a short hike up the stairs to the viewpoint before clambering down the other side to reach the famous Kayangan Lake. It’s a crystal clear, freshwater lake with unbelievable underwater rock formations, which make it one of the most incredible sites in Coron, Palawan.</p>
